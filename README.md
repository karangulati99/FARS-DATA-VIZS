# FARS-DATA-VIZS
We applied the understanding on achieving Data Migration using Talend as an ETL tool to use the NHTSA FARS 2015 Data which is a typical OLAP data. The FARS data gives detailed information about fatalities occurring during car crashes in USA and this data is maintained by NHTSA which is responsible for issuing all the Traffic Safety guidelines to the registered vehicle owners as well as pedestrians.
The Tableau visualizations were built to understand these crashes and its related information and make sure a great understanding of this when presenting this visual information to someone who is unaware of this data.
The understanding of Tableau was similarly applied on the COVID-19 India Data as well and the visualizations were built to understand this data.
